I would like it to have authentication because I will be hosting it

- I need to investigate how to host a database, specifically a libsql database
  - can I have a testing and production one?

Then I need to start building the data model

- I would also need to confirm if libsql supports rag, also curious what the AI on demand part of the MVP doc means

Then build

Create the

/auth page

I want a centered, slightly wide worm with a checkbox that would say somethin glike "register" using the $state rune

it shouldn't not be accessible if the user already has signed in
- using the page.server

It would have both the sign-in and register on one page, just providing different buttons for
different things

follow the brand style

if components are created
