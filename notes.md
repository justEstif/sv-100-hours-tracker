I would like it to have authentication because I will be hosting it

- I need to investigate how to host a database, specifically a libsql database
  - can I have a testing and production one?

Then I would like to setup some of the brand guidelines using the anthropic skill

- I might just have to edit the skill they provide or create a brand new one?
- I am not exactly sure about this step
- I need to confirm if daisyui would be useful here

Then I need to start building the data model

- I would also need to confirm if libsql supports rag, also curious what the AI on demand part of the MVP doc means

Then build
