# 100 Hours Tracker

Track long-term skill commitments with reflections and milestone synthesis.

## Problem

It's easy to sample many interests shallowly but hard to develop genuine depth. Most productivity tools optimize for task completion or streaks, not sustained engagement over months.

## Solution

A focused tracker for 3-4 annual "deep dives." Log time, write reflections, and synthesize your learning at milestones (25/50/75/100 hours). Optional AI analysis surfaces patterns you might have missed.

## Quick Start

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your values.
